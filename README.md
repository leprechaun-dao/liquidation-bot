# Leprechaun Protocol Liquidation Bot

A minimal-requirement liquidation bot for the Leprechaun Protocol that uses viem for blockchain interactions. This bot automatically monitors the protocol for under-collateralized positions, assesses their profitability, and executes liquidations when profitable.

Designed for low cost, low overhead and fast warm starts using Vercel Functions.

## Features

- üîç **Automated Scanning**: The bot periodically scans the protocol for under-collateralized positions using the Lens contract's `getLiquidatablePositions` function.
- üí∞ **Profitability Assessment**: For each liquidatable position, the bot calculates whether executing the liquidation would be profitable, considering:
  - The amount of synthetic tokens needed to repay the debt
  - The amount of collateral that would be received
  - The protocol fee
  - The liquidation discount
  - The gas cost of the transaction
  - The minimum profit threshold configured
- ‚ö° **Execution**: For positions that are determined to be profitable, the bot:
  - Checks if the liquidator has sufficient synthetic tokens
  - Approves the position manager to spend the tokens if necessary
  - Executes the liquidation by calling the liquidate function
  - Waits for the transaction to be mined and verifies the success
- üìä **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to ensure reliability
- üîÑ **Batch Processing**: Process multiple liquidations in sequence
- üì± **Vercel Compatible**: Uses viem for simplicity and performance, compatible with Vercel functions

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or later
- Ethereum private key with some ETH on base for gas
- Synthetic tokens for repaying debt during liquidations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Configuration

Edit the `.env` file to configure the bot:

```
# Network Configuration
RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key
CHAIN_ID=1

# Private Key - KEEP THIS SECURE!
LIQUIDATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here

```

## Usage

### Build the Bot

```bash
npm run build
```

### Start the Bot

```bash
npm start
```

### Run Just a Scanner

To scan for liquidatable positions without executing liquidations:

```bash
npm run scan
```

### Run a Single Liquidation

To execute a single liquidation for a specific position:

```bash
npm run liquidate -- --position-id 123
```

## Architecture

The bot consists of the following key components:

1. **Scanner**: Identifies liquidatable positions and calculates profitability
2. **Liquidator**: Executes liquidations for profitable positions
3. **Monitor**: Schedules scanning and liquidation runs
4. **Utils**: Helper functions for blockchain interactions, logging, and configuration

### Key Files

- `src/index.ts`: Main entry point
- `src/scanner.ts`: Scans for liquidatable positions
- `src/liquidator.ts`: Executes liquidations
- `src/monitor.ts`: Schedules and monitors liquidation runs
- `src/utils/config.ts`: Configuration loading and clients setup
- `src/utils/logger.ts`: Logging utilities
- `src/utils/blockchain.ts`: Blockchain interaction utilities
- `src/utils/tokens.ts`: Token-related utilities

## Deployment as a Vercel Function

This bot can be deployed as a Vercel Function:

1. Fork this repository
2. Connect it to your Vercel account
3. Set up environment variables in Vercel
4. Deploy the function

## Security Considerations

- **Private Key Security**: Never commit your private key to version control
- **Fund Management**: Only keep enough funds for active liquidations
- **Gas Management**: Configure proper ETH gas limits to avoid failed transactions
